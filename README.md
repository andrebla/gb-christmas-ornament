A christmas tree ornament made with 90 LED matrix, a buzzer, 8 touch buttons, powered by a rechargeable Li-ion battery. It uses a ATSAMD21 microcontroller, so it's compatible with Arduino and CircuitPython.

It can show animations in the buit-in LED matrix, reproduce Chiptune sounds using the buzzer and interact with a user by touch buttons present in the circuit board. You can use it to play some simple games!

The USB Type-C connector is used to charge the lil-ion battery and to upload firmware to the microcontroller.
